## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Inspiration: 
We wanted to create a means for people to do something good for the world and at the same time benefit their health.

## What it does: 
It allows users to log in the numbers of cups of water they drink and accordingly water virtual plants.

## How we built it: 
We drew the designs/screens, built the front-end using Flutter and Dart, and built the back-end using Firebase.

## Challenges we ran into: 
Learning Firebase in a short amount of time, getting people on the same page in terms of code, Connecting the front-end and back-end.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of: 
Finishing the final product.

## What we learned: 
Learnt to work together with other programmers, learnt how to connect drawings with front-end design, learnt more about back-end, and learnt to connect front-end with back-end

## What's next for Grow: 
### We plan to stay in touch to expand the app even more in some ways:
- Keeping plants at certain levels give you different number of points compete with friends feature plant decay for not consistently logging water 
- different kinds of plants with different levels of points 
- use real-life money to save plants that died in the process of growing virtual plant
- sitter for when going on vacation/ pay people to work with you
- And also polish the product's design and source code

## Built With
